## Executive Summary

**PrivacyPolicyGen** is a SaaS product that generates professional, legally-compliant privacy policies and terms of service documents through a simple questionnaire interface. The platform targets startups, small businesses, bloggers, and app developers who need affordable legal documentation without hiring expensive attorneys.

### The Problem
Every website and app needs a privacy policy to comply with laws like GDPR, CCPA, and app store requirements. However:
- Hiring a lawyer costs $500-$2,000+ per document
- DIY templates are often outdated or non-compliant
- Existing generators are expensive ($50-$200/year) or low quality

### Our Solution
PrivacyPolicyGen offers a free tier for basic users and affordable premium plans for businesses that need multiple policies. Our questionnaire-based approach creates customized, compliant documents in under 5 minutes.

### Business Model
- **Free Tier:** 1 policy per month (lead generation)
- **Pro Monthly:** $15/month for unlimited policies
- **Lifetime:** $79 one-time payment for lifetime access

### Revenue Projection (Year 1)
- Target: 10,000 free users, 500 paid subscribers
- Monthly recurring revenue: $7,500
- Annual revenue: $90,000 + $15,800 (lifetime deals) = **$105,800**

- **Paid Subscribers:** ~600
- **MRR by Month 12:** $8,940
- **Total Revenue:** $61,211

| 1 | 40,000 | 12,000 | 600 | $61,211 |
| 2 | 150,000 | 45,000 | 2,250 | $180,000 |

### Break-even Analysis
- **Monthly costs:** ~$200 (hosting, tools)
- **Break-even MRR:** $200

- **Break-even timeline:** Month 1 (low fixed costs)

### Unit Economics

**Projected Unit Economics (at scale):**

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) | $20-30 | Via organic/content marketing |
| Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) | $15/mo | Pro monthly |
| Monthly Churn Rate | 5% | Industry average |
| Average Customer Lifetime | 20 months | 1/churn rate |
| Lifetime Value (LTV) | $300 | ARPU x Lifetime |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 10-15x | Excellent (target: 3x+) |

**Why LTV:CAC is Strong:**
1. Low CAC due to SEO-driven acquisition
2. Sticky product (users don't change privacy policies often)
3. Lifetime deal option reduces churn further
4. High intent keywords = high conversion rates
